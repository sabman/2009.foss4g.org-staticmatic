  Short_Description:
    This workshop offers a practical introduction to two new Open Source projects in the Geospatial Business Intelligence field: GeoMondrian, a Spatial OLAP server based on Mondrian (Pentaho Analysis Services), and Spatialytics, a web-mapping client for building Geo BI solutions (dashboards and web Spatial OLAP clients) based on OpenLayers.
  Long_Description:
    Open Source Business Intelligence (BI) software has begun permeating the market thanks to offers from companies such as Pentaho, Jaspersoft, Talend and Spago Solutions. Geospatial BI, combining GIS and BI technologies, has recently stirred marked interest for the huge potential of combining spatial analysis and map visualization with proven BI tools and techniques such as data warehousing, Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) and data mining. It is in this perspective that we, the GeoSOA Research Group at Laval University, started to work on integrating geospatial functionality in existing open source BI software. This has led to the release of GeoKettle, a spatial ETL tool based on Pentaho Data Integration (Kettle) and targeted for analytic data warehousing, and more recently GeoMondrian, a Spatial OLAP server which extends the open source Mondrian OLAP server with GIS data types and functions. On the client side, Spatialytics has been developed, initially during a Google Summer of Code project mentored by Dr. Thierry Badard under the umbrella of the OSGeo and later as part of works within our research group. Spatialytics provides a client visualization component for Spatial OLAP data, using GeoMondrian as a data source and OpenLayers as the web mapping front-end. It enables the creation of drillable, interactive thematic maps based on multidimensional OLAP cubes and can be embedded in Geo BI web applications such as geo-analytical dashboards.
    This workshop proposes a practical introduction to GeoMondrian and Spatialytics. A short intro to the fundamental concepts of data warehousing and OLAP will be part of the program, so deep knowledge of this field is not required to participate. From an already constructed spatial data warehouse, the attendees will learn how to build a cube schema, which is a relational-to-multidimensional mapping used by Mondrian (and by extension GeoMondrian) for querying the relational data warehouse (in SQL) by the means of multidimensional MDX queries. The users will then have a chance to issue simple queries on this cube, with focus given on the geospatial extensions to MDX offered by GeoMondrian. Finally, the attendees will experiment with Spatialytics, for the visualization of the cube’s data using its spatial dimensions. This will also demonstrate its integration in the familiar OpenLayers web mapping client, with easy to use navigation widgets for drilling across the cube’s hierarchical presentation of data and configurable choice of thematic mapping styles. At the end, the attendees should have a working knowledge of GeoMondrian and Spatialytics, in order to build rich Geo BI applications.
  User_Prerequisites:
    Good knowledge of SQL and Simple Feature for SQL geospatial extensions (e.g. PostGIS)
    Basic knowledge of OpenLayers
    Knowledge of data warehousing and OLAP (MDX language) is an asset but is not required

  Short_Description:
    This workshop provides a hands-on introduction to the “OpenGeo Stack”, comprised of PostGIS, GeoServer, GeoWebCache, and OpenLayers. Workshop attendees will work through exercises targeted at building up a complete web mapping solution from scratch.
  Long_Description:
    "The workshop will begin with an introduction of the stack, providing an overview of each of the major components:
    PostGIS: A spatially enabled relational database based on PostgreSQL. PostGIS is the backbone of many open source and non-open source based GIS systems.
    GeoServer: A feature rich standards compliant server that connects information to the geospatial web. GeoServer reads a variety of spatial formats and publishes that data on the web through standard services and formats.
    GeoWebCache: A WMS tile-caching library that provides an effective solution for the efficient serving of web maps.
    OpenLayers: A web based mapping toolkit built on Ajax technology. OpenLayers provides a web based front end for a number of web mapping technologies such as WMS and WFS.
    Following the introduction workshop attendees will begin the hands-on component. Exercises will cumulatively build off each other and work toward the goal of setting up a simple base map of the Manhattan area.
    Initial exercises will focus on performing simple tasks with GeoServer such as publishing shapefiles, setting up styles for map visualization, and use of the map preview tool.
    Once the basics of GeoServer have been covered attendees will be exposed to PostGIS. These exercises will focus on loading spatial data into PostGIS, as well as configuring GeoServer to connect to a PostGIS database.
    With a functioning GeoServer setup on top of PostGIS focus will shift to the creation of the Manhattan base map. This section will focus mainly on map style configuration and exploring the capabilities of Styled Layer Descriptor (SLD) for the visualization of spatial data. 
    Once the base map has been set up attendees will build a simple web based map using the OpenLayers library. This component involves some web scripting with JavaScript, in which attendees will learn how to visualize a GeoServer WMS with OpenLayers. Additionally some of the OpenLayers styling capabilities will also be explored.
    The final part of the workshop will focus on GeoWebCache, using it to add tile-caching capabilities to the base map."
  User_Prerequisites:
    A passing familiarity with any of the stack components is beneficial. Workshop attendees should be familiar with interacting with web applications through the browser. Familiarity with the windows command line is also beneficial. Some JavaScript.

  Long_Description:
    "GRASS is the leading FOSS GIS and its wide ranging analysis capabilities make it an ideal tool to set up environmental models, as well as to support land planning and management.
    Therefore, GRASS can be an important tool in general for environmental researchers and in particular for scientists and planners in Developing Countries. In fact, GRASS has been already successfully used in many projects in Africa, Asia and Latin America. However, its steep learning curve makes the first approach to GRASS sometimes tricky for beginners: this workshop aims to overcome the initial barrier between GRASS and its potential users.
    The workshop has two parts: a brief GRASS overview and a hands-on session by the attendees.
    The aim is to allow the first users to understand the logic of the software and to experiment some significant, although necessarily limited, data elaboration for technical and environmental GIS applications. The workshop provides a brief introduction to GRASS and then it is structured as a step by step tutorial to guide beginners in the basic applications of the software, stressing the interoperability with other FOSS and proprietary software. The tutorial is structured in a growing difficulty level to make the participants gradually familiar with the software. It will be possible for the participants to follow different paths depending on their skills and interests."

    "Are you new to GeoSpatial? Are you not cool enough to be a Neo-Geographer AJAX empowered meta tagging Ruby wunderkind ? Does scientific mumbo-jumbo make your head hurt? Are you (gasp!) just out to get the job done? Come to this tutorial and go home happy.
    This Java tutorial is developers who are new to the GeoSpatial scene - it offers an introduction to concepts, projects, and how to avoid common pitfalls.
    We will start with something nice, fun and visual - fetching content from Web Map Servers. The focus is on you and the code you need to get the job done.
    We will explore what maps are made of: Features (literally things you can draw on a Map), Geometry (what to actually draw) and details like units and coordinate reference systems. These ideas are represented as nice normal Java objects by the GeoTools and Java Topology Suite projects.
    We will work with common data formats and show how to make queries and modify information. For visualisation we will use a nice Swing widget and show how to control the rendering system with style.
    Attend this tutorial - it will be very much hands on – and fun."
